## Creating a New Habit

1. Navigate to the **Habits** page using the navigation bar
2. Click the **"New Habit"** button in the top-right corner
3. A form dialog will appear with three fields:

### Name (required)
- Type a short, descriptive name for your habit
- Examples: "Morning meditation", "Read 30 minutes", "Drink 8 glasses of water"
- Maximum 50 characters

### Description (optional)
- Add context about why this habit matters to you
- Example: "Start each day with 10 minutes of calm to reduce stress"
- Maximum 200 characters

### Color
- Pick one of 9 colors by tapping a color circle
- The selected color shows a checkmark and a ring around it
- This color will appear on your dashboard checkbox and habit card
- Available colors: Red, Orange, Amber, Green, Emerald, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Pink

4. Click **"Create Habit"** to save

Your new habit immediately appears in your habit list and on the dashboard's "Today" section.

## Editing a Habit

1. Go to the **Habits** page
2. Find the habit you want to change
3. Click the **"Edit"** button on the habit card
4. Update the name, description, or color
5. Click **"Save"** to apply changes

Editing a habit does not affect your completion history or streaks. Only the name, description, and color can be changed.

## Archiving a Habit

Archiving is a "soft delete" - the habit disappears from your daily tracking but all your historical data is preserved.

1. Go to the **Habits** page
2. Click the **"Archive"** button on the habit card
3. The habit moves to the **Archived** section at the bottom of the page

**When to archive**: Use archiving when you want to stop tracking a habit but keep your streak and completion history. For example, if you've mastered a habit and want to focus on new ones.

**What happens when you archive**:
- The habit no longer appears on your dashboard
- It doesn't count toward your stats or completion rate
- Your past completions and streaks are saved
- You can restore it anytime

## Restoring an Archived Habit

1. Go to the **Habits** page
2. Scroll down to the **"Archived"** section (click to expand if collapsed)
3. Click the **"Restore"** button on the archived habit

The habit returns to your active list with all its historical data intact.

## Deleting a Habit Permanently

Deletion is irreversible. It removes the habit and all its completion history.

1. Go to the **Habits** page
2. The habit must be **archived first** (delete is only available for archived habits)
3. In the Archived section, click the **"Delete"** button
4. A confirmation dialog will appear warning you this cannot be undone
5. Click **"Delete"** to confirm

**What gets deleted**:
- The habit itself
- Every completion record for that habit across all dates
- Streak data (since it's calculated from completions)

**Tip**: If you're unsure, archive instead of deleting. You can always delete later, but you can't undo a delete.

## Understanding the Habits Page

Your habits page has two sections:

### Active Habits
These are the habits you're currently tracking. Each card shows:
- **Color dot** - The habit's assigned color
- **Name** - The habit name in bold
- **Description** - Shown below the name (if provided), limited to 2 lines
- **Edit button** - Opens the edit form
- **Archive button** - Moves to archived section

### Archived Habits
A collapsible section showing the count of archived habits. Click to expand. Each archived card shows:
- The habit name (with strikethrough styling to indicate it's inactive)
- **Restore button** - Returns to active list
- **Delete button** - Permanently removes (with confirmation)

## Tips

- **Color strategy**: Assign different colors to different categories (e.g., green for health, blue for learning, purple for creativity) to visually distinguish habits at a glance
- **Start small**: Begin with 2-3 habits. It's better to build consistency with fewer habits than to overwhelm yourself with many
- **Use descriptions**: Write down *why* a habit matters. Seeing your motivation when you check it off reinforces the behavior
