## Checking Off a Habit

1. Open the app - you'll land on the **Dashboard**
2. Look at the **"Today"** card, which shows all your active habits
3. Tap or click the **circle** next to a habit name to mark it complete

When you check a habit:
- The circle fills with the habit's color
- A checkmark draws itself inside the circle
- The habit name gets a strikethrough
- The "X/Y completed" counter updates at the top

### Unchecking a Habit

Made a mistake? Simply tap the filled circle again to uncheck it. The completion is removed and the counter decreases.

## Understanding the Today Card

The Today card shows:

```
Today                    Monday, Jan 15
3/5 completed

[ ] Morning meditation          1d | 5d best
[x] Read 30 minutes            12d | 12d best
[x] Exercise                    3d | 15d best
[ ] Drink water                 0d | 8d best
[x] Journal                     7d | 10d best
```

### What each part means

- **Date**: Today's day name and date shown in the top-right
- **Progress counter**: "3/5 completed" means 3 of your 5 active habits are done
- **Circle**: Empty circle = not done yet, Colored circle with checkmark = done
- **Habit name**: The name you gave your habit
- **Streak badges**: Show your current streak and best streak (see [How to Build Streaks](./how-to-build-streaks.md))

## What Gets Saved

Every time you check or uncheck a habit, the change is **saved instantly** to your browser's local storage. You don't need to click a "Save" button.

Your data persists even if you:
- Close the browser tab
- Restart your browser
- Shut down your computer

Your data will **not** persist if you:
- Clear your browser's site data/cookies
- Use private/incognito mode (data is lost when the window closes)
- Switch to a different browser or device

**Tip**: Use the [Export feature](./how-to-manage-data.md) to back up your data regularly.

## When to Track

The app tracks habits on a **daily** basis. Each day is a fresh start:
- Check off habits as you complete them throughout the day
- All checkboxes reset at midnight (a new day begins)
- You don't need to check them all at once - come back anytime during the day

## No Habits Yet?

If your Today card shows **"No habits yet"**, you need to create your first habit:

1. Click the **"Create Habit"** button in the empty state, or
2. Navigate to the **Habits** page and click **"New Habit"**

See [How to Manage Habits](./how-to-manage-habits.md) for a detailed guide on creating habits.

## Tips

- **Check in the morning**: Review your habits each morning to set your intentions for the day
- **Don't break the chain**: Seeing your streak grow is a powerful motivator - try to check off every habit every day
- **Be honest**: Only mark a habit complete if you actually did it. The data is only useful if it's accurate
